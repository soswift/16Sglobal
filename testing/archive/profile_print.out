### EMP Dataset

Qiita 16S Pipeline outputs: EMP + Waimea raw OTU table (read in as data.table)
size =  65.29 GB
dimensions =  "303397" "28182" 

Sequence ids column of OTU table (i.e. full nucleotide sequence)
size =  53.2 Mb
length = 303397

EMP + Waimea raw OTU table, after dropping sequence ids
size =  65.24 GB
dimensions = "303397" "28180" 

Qita OTU table subset: Samples from Waimea Valley (No EMP)
size =  3.81 GB
dimensions = "303397" "1645"  

Qiita OTU table subset: Samples from EMP dataset (No Waimea)
size = 61.42 GB
dimensions = [1] "303397" "26535" 

Culling Qiita OTU table:

	Culling OTUS from data
	min number of samples for OTU to be present in =  3
	min abundance of OTU to count as being present =  500
	minimum single abundance in a sample = 10
	Starting # OTUS = 303397
	Post-Cull # OTUS = 6632

Qiita OTU table culled
size =  1.43 GB
dimensions =  "6632"  "28180"

### HPC Dataset

HPC 16S OTU table
size = 2.4 GB
dimensions = "1732", "355694"


Transposed 16S OTU table (samples as columns,like Qiita table)
size = 4.6 GB
dimensions = "355694", "1732"

Culling HPC OTU table (same criteria):

	Culling OTUS from data
	min number of samples for OTU to be present in =  3
	min abundance of OTU to count as being present =  500
	minimum single abundance in a sample = 10
	Starting # OTUS = 3556893
	Post-Cull # OTUS = 238878

HPC OTU table culled
size = 1.6 GB
dimensions = "1732" , "238879"
